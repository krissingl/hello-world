# hello-world
first repo

//Hello folks! I'm here trying real hard to understand how to make git work on my computer, I have never done this before! I like drawing, writing, and playing video games in my free time. I also will occasionally play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. I want to become a programming so that I can pursue a career that will pay me well- that way I can finally afford all the things I,ve been needing; for instance, I need to fix my teeth, get a new mattress, purchase some work-out equiptment, help my mom buys herself a house, and much more! I'm excited and looking forward to the day where I can go to work and produce something, rather than my days currently where I repeat the same day again and agina with nothing to show for it.
